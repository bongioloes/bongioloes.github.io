										<h4>My love story with data analytics</h4>
										<p>How a Master's program in Forestry made me pursue a career in data analysis</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									In 2018, I was cursing through my Master's program at the University of Florida, trying to figure out how I would use MS Excel to model the growth and production of trees and analyze the results.
								</p>
								<p>
									Fortunately, I soon found two courses that changed my life. The first class was an intro to stats, where I learned the basics of statistics and R. This gave me the means to pursue more information and was the foundation for the data management and analysis of the thesis. But an essential part of the project was still missing: the predictions. That is when I found the second course, which taught me how to create and analyze simulations of forest ecosystems using Python as a tool. I had my first experience using programming languages in the spring of 2018, and I fell in love with it. By the end of that year, I was finishing up my thesis thanks to the fully functional prediction model and stats scripts I developed. At that moment, I didn't even realize that data analytics could be a career option.
								</p>
								<p>
									After graduating, I started working as a freelancer, using my current skills and developing new ones. One project I treasured having participated in was the Community of Practice and Learning Focused on the Governance and Infrastructure in the Amazon (<a href="https://giamazon.org/">GIA</a>). I was part of the Geospatial group, where our objective was to tackle the project using remote sensing and GIS methods and data to analyze the results from a geographic point of view. I was once again working with data analytics, creating tools to collect data and, later on, finding patterns and creating visualizations to represent the data and the results. But I still had no clue that what I was doing was data analysis itself and that it could be a career.
								</p>
								<p>
									In late 2019 I moved back to Brazil with plans to move to Germany short after that. I had a life-long dream of living in Germany because of my grandparents, who are German. So in early 2020, I obtained my German citizenship and booked my flight. Unfortunately (to the whole world), the pandemic hit, and I put my plans on stand-by. In the meantime, I kept working as a freelancer and deepening my knowledge in data analysis. I took the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science at edX.org, a couple of Linkedin courses, and played around with R and Python. Around that time, I started reading more about Data Analytics and finally started seeing it as a possible career.
								</p>
								<p>
									More than a year later, in May of 2021, I was finally able to come to Germany. I was offered a job at an Eis Cafe (Coffee shop + Ice cream), where I worked for a few months to make some money. Currently, I am taking German classes and looking for a full-time job in Data Analytics while continuously studying and playing with data.
