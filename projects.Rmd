### **Current project**
#### Evaluation of swidden fallow potential to increase landscape-level Brazil nut (*Bertholletia excelsa*) productivity in western amazonia
**Master Thesis** - This study examines the extent to which forest residents could increase nut productivity by allowing their fallows to grow into Brazil nut rich forests. Brazil nut (*Bertholletia excelsa*) is considered the ‘cornerstone non-timber species of Amazonian conservation’. Nuts (or seeds) of this massive tree are harvested by local people living in and near old growth forests, supporting local livelihoods and regional economies. Secondary forests, however, particularly plots previously used for agriculture (swidden fallows), present better B. excelsa seedling and sapling recruitment than mature forest. But no study have look at the future perspectives of secondary forest.

**Summary of methods:**   
1.Model written in python to estimate growht, survival and fruit production in 10, 20,30 and 40 years.  
2.Management of the model’s output data in Rstudio (R).  
3.Elaboration of map by integrating the result of the data management with shape files with study area delimitation, study sites location and properties location.

  **Map description**:This is the result of a class project, which was used as the first step for the remote sensing section of my thesis. The project was designed to answer two questions: How much area is covered by secondary forest created since 2013 at the study site? and where these forests are located within the study area?
Three Landsat 8 images (from 2013, 2015 and 2017) were acquired from the Earth Explorer website.Methods included transforming the images using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) and Principal Components Analyses (PCA) to extract information to be, together with training samples acquired on Google Earth, feed to the supervised classifier. ERDAS Imagine does not have an EVI function as a standard tool, therefore Model Maker was used to performing such transformation to the images. Maximum likelihood supervised classification was used to distinguish pixels in Forest or Non-Forest. The final step of the project was to run a change detection algorithm (Matrix Union) over the three classified images (2013-2015-2017) to determinate when a Non-forest pixel, which was a forest in previous images, is now classified as forest again. Software used: ERDAS Imagine to all the data manipulation and analysis and ArcGIS (ArcMap) to elaboration of the map.
